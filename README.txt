To compile the program all that needs to be done is type make in the folder. There is a make file provided so it will compile the program. Once the make command is ran you will need to type "java Raytracer driverfilename targetimagename" where driverfielname will be the name of the driver file being read into the program and targetimagename will be the name of the image you wish to create. The driver files that you want to run will be the monte.txt and that will show you that I implemented Monte Carlo raytracing. Then there is the driver.txt and that will be a smaller image of my final render. I have attached a 2048x2048 of that image as well.
